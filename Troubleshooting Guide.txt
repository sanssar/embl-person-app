===================== Troubleshooting Guide ===================================

1) Ensure the docker environment path variable is setup by running "docker --version" command. If you see error, please setup the docker environment path variable.

2) Verify docker daemon is running by using "docker info" command.Please start the docker daemon if this is the case.
	"ERROR: error during connect: This error may indicate that the docker daemon is not running."
	
3) If the port 8999 is already in use, update the command to run on different port. Eg, with below command , you could use http://localhost:8990 fom your browser
	docker build -t embl-person-app . && docker run -p 8990:8999 embl-person-app
	
4) Verify there are no errors in logs and "Status" shows up for container before proceeding by using below command.
	docker ps --filter "ancestor=embl-person-app"

5) If you are unable to deploy onto docker environment, you can also start the app with the fat jar available in target folder.
	To do this you need to have JDK11 setup on your classpath,navigate to "target" folder & run below command. 
	java -jar embl-person-app-1.0.0-RELEASE.jar
